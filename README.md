# Thesis

In this project, my task was to implement, and compare 5 different thinning algorithms on greyscale images.

The common method up until these attempts was to convert the greyscale images to black and white pictures and thin the result.

These algorithms provide a different approach.

The papers in chronological order:
* Dyer Rosenfeld 1997
* Salari Siy 1984
* Kang 1998

To use these functions, you have to install the requirements first from the requirements.txt file with the command: 
> pip install -r requirements.txt

# What I learned

* Python syntax
* opencv
